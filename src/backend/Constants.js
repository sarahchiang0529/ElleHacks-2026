export const INTRO_PROMPT = "Give me a short introductory story that will be used to narrate the introduction of a game for young kids aged 7-12. The game focuses on the main character, the player, travelling through a town and helping the towns people with various challenges. The challenges teaches the player about online security (i.e. scam texts and calls) and also teaches the player about financial literacy. Give me only the story, nothing else. Give it to me in a script format where you have the name of the person speaking (i.e. narrator or character) followed by a colon (make sure there are no other colons in the text, besides to indicate a character's line) so that I can later use javascript to split the text and create two item tuples. Ensure that the character's names are gender-neutral and that there is only 2 voices that are needed (i.e. the narrator, and a character).";
